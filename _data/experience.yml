    Managed activities related to using an open-source C++ library in the lab. Used it to develop a code for an intercontinental project 
    sponsored by European Space Agency and NASA. The code resulted in a half-million-dollar grant on which I was listed as the code developer. 
    Published three top-tier journal papers. Mentored Ph.D. students later using the code. 

    Created automated workflows that post-processed raw data into the publication-quality visualizations with a single click. 
    Saved hundreds of hours of human time over two years.
