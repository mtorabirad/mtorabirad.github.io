    Used RL to optimize the parameters of a market-neutral pairs-trading strategy. Utilized Monte Carlo Policy Gradient. 
    In the original GitHub repository, forked/starred more than a hundred times, fixed a critical bug that was unresolved 
    for more than ten months [link]. Extended the code from stateless to contextual bandit. Identified stock pairs in the top 
    three S&P500 sectors. The RL optimized parameters resulted in a significant increase in the final return compared to standard parameter values.

    Extended the application of neural networks to my research field for the first time. Analyzed the deteriorating effects of an oscillating loss on a 
    networkâ€™s ability to fit training data and on its inference performance. Introduced a theory-training technique that, by leveraging 
    regularization, eliminates those oscillations, decreases the final training loss, and improves the inference accuracy, with no additional 
    computational cost. Invited to give a seminar about the project at NVIDIA.

    Developed an object-oriented code using scikit-learn, following software-engineering best practices, to build linear/tree-based 
    regression models to predict Airbnb prices. Performed feature engineering/selection, Grid Search hyper-parameter tuning, statistical 
    hypothesis testing, and feature importance analysis. Drew insights that can be used to make more profitable business decisions.

    Deployed a TensorFlow model on Google Cloud. Conducted profile-guided optimization. Restructured the code to keep parts exposed to 
    incoming requests to an absolute minimum. Resulted in an about 5X improvement in the response time.
